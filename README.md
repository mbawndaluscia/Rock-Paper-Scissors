# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Two-Player Cannon Shooter inspired by the playground Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
Each player controls a cannon which fires random bullets-rocks,papers scissors and stars.
When 2 bullets collide  they react as follows: 
Rock kills scissors, scissors kills paper, paper kills rock, star kills everything else. 
Players score a point if one of their bullets kills a bullet of their opponent. 
Stars don't score points, and self destruct after 5 seconds. Use them to clear paths for you to score points.
There are also stoppers roaming across the screen which will cause rocks/scissors/paper to freeze. 
First to 20 points wins!
Remember it can be useful to kill your own bullets, to stop your opponent scoring points from them!
